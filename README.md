# Work_from_home_classification
Predict if people prefer WFH vs WFO post Covid-19. Dataset is collected from Kaggle. Since the pandemic began, most of us have been working from home. I wanted to see if people preferred working from home or they missed going back to office. I collected this from kaggle and I decided to use this real data to see to what accuracy algorithm can predict the results.
